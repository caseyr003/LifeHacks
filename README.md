# LifeHacks
An iOS application written in objective-C that allows users to watch a set of YouTube videos straight from their app. 

This app uses NSURLSession to talk to a server that was created with node to download the data. It uses YouTube's iframe to display the video in a webview so that user's can watch it directly from the app.
